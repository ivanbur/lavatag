9 people, one muderer, eight innocents. when lights go out, murderer tries to kill somebody.

innocent = bystander

maybe ascii art

language being used are: javascript, html, css, python (a little bit)

multiple people can play from different computers (up to 9 per game room or we can have everybody in one room with a ratio of 8 bystanders to one murderer)

The bystanders are trying to kill or catch the murderer before he kills all the innocents
Nobody knows who murderer is except for the murderer


Murderer has knife
One out of every eight bystander has a gun
Bystanders are trying to work together to kill the murderer, but if a bystander shoots another bystander then he is disqualified and drops the gun
Murderer can sprint
Murderer can also see footprints left behind by bystanders, colored by bystander (each bystander has their own color)
Footprints vanish after a while
Murderer will take victim's name and color after killing somebody to avoid being caught
If the murderer doesn't kill anybody for a period of time they turn black

Ratio of 8 bystanders to one murderer

The room that you are in is lit up so that you can see it and the other ones are dark
When a player dies, it says "Player has died" at the top (it doesn't use the name of the player)
9 rooms (3x3 grid)
